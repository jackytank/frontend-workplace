# Docker Review and Learning Path

## Review

- [ ] **Docker Compose:** Defined a multi-container application with services for the frontend, backend, database, and cache. Correct use of `networks` and `volumes`.
- [ ] **Dockerfile:** Multi-stage builds for both the frontend and backend are efficient, allowing for smaller production images by separating dependencies and build stages.

## Topics to Explore

- [ ] **Container Orchestration:** Learn about Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for managing multiple containers across different hosts.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration:** Understand how to integrate Docker with continuous integration and deployment pipelines.
- [ ] **Security Practices:** Study best practices for securing Docker containers and images, such as using non-root users.
- [ ] **Networking:** Dive deeper into Docker networking, understanding bridge, host, and overlay networks.
- [ ] **Logging and Monitoring:** Explore centralized logging solutions and monitoring tools for Docker containers.
- [ ] **Optimization:** Learn how to optimize your Docker images for size, build time, and performance.
- [ ] **Docker API:** Familiarize yourself with the Docker API for programmatic container management.
- [ ] **Advanced Build Techniques:** Look into build optimizations like build caching and using `.dockerignore` files.

_Remember:_ Docker is a vast topic, and becoming fully efficient requires hands-on experience and continuous learning. Keep experimenting with different scenarios and use cases to deepen your understanding.
