## oddOccurrencesInArrayXOR
The XOR operation is a bitwise operation that returns 1 if the inputs are different and 0 if they are the same. For example, 3 XOR 5 is 6, because 3 in binary is 0011 and 5 in binary is 0101, and XORing each bit gives 0110, which is 6 in decimal.

The XOR logic for this problem is based on two properties of XOR:

XOR is commutative, which means that the order of the operands does not matter. For example, 3 XOR 5 is the same as 5 XOR 3.
XOR is self-inverse, which means that XORing a number with itself gives 0. For example, 3 XOR 3 is 0.
Using these properties, we can XOR all the elements in the array and get the element that occurs an odd number of times. This is because the elements that occur an even number of times will cancel out each other and give 0, and the element that occurs an odd number of times will remain. For example, if the array is [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9], then XORing all the elements gives:

9 XOR 3 XOR 9 XOR 3 XOR 9 XOR 7 XOR 9

= (9 XOR 9) XOR (3 XOR 3) XOR (9 XOR 9) XOR 7

= 0 XOR 0 XOR 0 XOR 7

= 7

So, the element that occurs an odd number of times is 7.

The box analogy is a way to visualize the XOR logic using a simpler concept. Imagine that you have a box that can store only one number at a time. You can put a number in the box or take it out. You can also compare the number in the box with another number and see if they are the same or different.

Now, suppose you have an array of numbers, like [9, 3, 9, 3, 9, 7, 9]. You want to find the number that occurs an odd number of times in the array. Here is what you can do:

- Start with an empty box.
- Loop over the array from left to right.
- For each number in the array, do the following:
    - If the box is empty, put the number in the box.
    - If the box is not empty, compare the number in the box with the current number.
        - If they are the same, take the number out of the box. This means that you have found a pair of numbers that occur twice in the array, so you  can ignore them.
        - If they are different, put the current number in the box. This means that you have found a new number that might occur an odd number of times in the array, so you keep it in the box.
- After you finish looping over the array, check the box. If the box is not empty, then the number in the box is the one that occurs an odd number of times in the array. If the box is empty, then there is no such number.

The box analogy is similar to the XOR logic, but instead of using binary numbers and bitwise operations, it uses decimal numbers and simple operations. The box represents the result of the XOR operation, and the putting/taking operations represent the XOR operation. The comparison operation is equivalent to the XOR operation, because it returns true if the numbers are different and false if they are the same.

To see how the box analogy matches the XOR logic, you can look at the table below, which shows the box and the result after each operation:


<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Decimal</th>
      <th>Binary</th>
      <th>XOR</th>
      <th>Result</th>
      <th>Box</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td></td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td>[9]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0011</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>1010</td>
      <td>[9, 3]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>0011</td>
      <td>[3]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3</td>
      <td>0011</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>0000</td>
      <td>[]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td>[9]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>7</td>
      <td>0111</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>1110</td>
      <td>[9, 7]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>9</td>
      <td>1001</td>
      <td>XOR</td>
      <td>0111</td>
      <td>[7]</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

You can see that the box and the result are always the same, except that the box uses decimal numbers and the result uses binary numbers. This shows that the box analogy is a valid way to understand the XOR logic.
